# Handoff (2026-09-27)

Read `CLAUDE.md`, then `AGENTS.md` (code map, test gotchas) and `docs/backlog.md`. Branch
`liquid-glass-redesign`. The full suite (426 tests) passed at b9789d9. Dev APK `GradatiON-dev-b9789d9.apk` was sent to the user.

## Done this session
- K1: Code transcript tool calls are single quiet lines. The session menu toggles Normal/Thinking
  view (`CodeStore.showThinking`, `CodeTranscriptAdapter.verbose`).
- R1: `RpPromptEngine` got per-character Memory (`SharedPreferencesHelper.getRpMemory`),
  `{{char}}`/`{{user}}` macros (the persona preset name is the user's name), scene-craft rules,
  and example dialogs on their own lines.
- R3: an empty RP composer turns send into Continue (`ChatViewModel.continueRpStory`, a "…" user
  beat plus `CONTINUE_DIRECTION`). The character pill opens `RpCharacterPanel`: titled glass cards
  (Memory, History, Persona, Style, Lore, Edit), with New chat and Switch in the header.
- P1: new `screenshots/` and fastlane shots, plus rewrites of README, `DESIGN.md` (the Grok token
  dump and `SHELL.md` are gone, still in history) and the store descriptions. `AGENTS.md` is new.

## Next
- Lorebooks match the scene (`RpLore`). Text above the first `[keys: …]` line is always included. A block under that line is included only when the recent chat, the character's name, or the scenario mentions a key. A character can pin its own book from the Lore card.
- Drop order: history goes first. Once it no longer fits, a long card keeps its first 4,000 characters (`RpApiMemory.definitionCap`). Long-press a Roleplay line to pin it; that line stays. A pin shows a small mark.
- Memory is the note you write and is not rewritten. Facts are a separate per-chat note (you, the character, and other people). The RP setting turns Facts off. A new chat asks to carry them or start fresh. Example lines use a stand-in name, not yours. `RpAutoMemoryTest` and `RpPromptEngineTest` passed.
- RP auto memory is done: after a reply, once the chat nears the API window (or 60 messages when
  memory is "All"), a quiet non-streamed call (`LlmService.completeOnce`) rewrites the character's
  Memory, at most every 6 messages. Switch in RP settings. The demo model answers it too. Voice/Layout/Wallpaper cards are done (RpVoiceDialog, ChatAdapter.rpLayout,
  AmbientBackgroundView.photoSlot with BackgroundPhoto slots "char_<id>").
- The old scroll-progress bar (the full-width line under the tabs) is off by default and fades
  when idle if someone turns it on.
- The phone still needs to check: Continue feel, the panel's blur and lens, the Thinking toggle, and
  all motion.

## UI clip pass (2026-09-27, fresh screenshots, not the old checklist)
Clipped labels, verified with the screenshot tests that cover each screen:
- RP settings Facts switch wrapped so "Your Memory note is left alone." is fully visible.
- Add-machine dialog wraps agent pills (Grok Build, Cursor CLI, Pi were off the card) and shows the
  full bridge example `wss://studio.tailnet.ts.net:7878/v1` under the address field.
- Code settings Demo machine row shows "nothing leaves the phone."
- Lorebook editor shows "Always-on lore, then [keys: word, phrase] blocks" under the field. It was a
  one-line hint cut at "phra…", then a helper line the text box covered.
`assembleDev` succeeded. The minified APK is `app/build/outputs/apk/dev/app-dev.apk`.
Phone still has to check motion, glass blur, and the Thinking toggle.

## UI bug pass (2026-09-27)
UI audit + fixes (112a867..27bf705): glass Snackbars (theme inverse colors), PDF Snackbar crash on a
recycled row, Markdown viewer follows the palette, shimmer pauses offscreen, shared Coil loader,
masked API-key fields, one-shot system message pick, visible checkbox checks, failures raise
GlassNotice (toasts stay silent), Code session edge to edge, 44dp hit areas (`TouchTargets`), glass
settings cards, strings moved to resources. 443 tests pass. `rpAutoMemoryUpdatesAfterReply` was stale
after the Facts split; it now checks Facts (and that Memory is untouched), and DemoModel answers the
"fact notes" prompt. Skipped: HTML/PDF export colors, GlassNotice under dialog dims, CodeHostDialog 36dp pill.
Phone: touch edges of send/mic, Code session insets + IME, Snackbar look, settings cards on a photo bg.
