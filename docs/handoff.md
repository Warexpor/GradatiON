# Handoff (2026-09-28, night)

## Navigation declutter (rp-polish, latest)
One home per thing. RP settings is gone: its three switches (third person, inner thoughts, auto facts) are a "Roleplay" group in the controls sheet (RP mode only). The character panel lost its Settings tile and gained a model line in its header, the one place to change the RP model. Removed entries: RP-tab long-press, Settings > Advanced "GradatiON RP", picker footer "RP model", pill long-press in RP. Library stays on the composer + footer and the history nav. App Settings: Haptics and Keep screen on live in Appearance; OpenRouter transforms moved to Models; LAN is "Local server" with its endpoint under it; Advanced folds five rarely used chat-chrome switches under "More"; Code settings lost its duplicate Code tab switch. Phone still has to check: the controls sheet height in RP (the group scrolls with the More area), the panel-to-popover handoff for the model line.

## Local models and navigation (2026-09-29)
- Local server sheet: type chips (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, KoboldCpp, Other), host-only address (port added on save), Test connection with plain-language errors, Choose models. The model list adds and selects in one tap. Chat and Roleplay each remember their own model.
- Local prompts are trimmed to the server's context window (auto-detect; Ollama auto assumes 4096 since /api/show reports the model max, not what runs). max_tokens capped at context/3. Reasoning and vision are guessed from the model id.
- Navigation: RP settings screen is gone (its switches live in the controls sheet in RP). The character panel header carries the model line. Hidden long-presses and the Advanced > GradatiON RP row are removed. Haptics and Keep screen on moved into Appearance.
- Phone still has to check: a real Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp test and send, the permission prompt on Android 17, and the controls sheet height in RP.

## RP polish branch `rp-polish`
The user asked for a new branch and a full RP UX pass. Work lives on `rp-polish`, not `liquid-glass-redesign`.
- Chat flow: swipe ‹ n/N › sits in the last reply's action row (it was hidden before). › never regenerates; the reroll button makes new alternates. Continue keeps alternates and stores the joined text. Blocked actions and view-model messages use GlassNotice. Editing a user message is non-destructive until send (edit bar, the edited bubble is highlighted, later rows are dimmed). Back in a thread goes to the RP home. Pin moved from long-press to the ⋮ menus (user rows got a ⋮). One New-chat path with the Facts question and no "replace?" confirm. Home delete removes every chat in a row.
- Library: the hub is now "Library" (no hero card; Import / Export rows). Import takes Tavern v1/v2/v3 JSON and PNG cards. Persona has its own Name field. RP settings has subtitles; the lorebook switch is gone (an active book is on). "Open scene" (LLM mode) lives in the character picker. The character editor puts Advanced behind a fold and shows errors on the fields. Lorebooks get an Active switch and a key-syntax warning.
- Phone still has to check: the edit-bar scroll and dimming, the swipe row, the file pickers (PNG cards), the panel's tile-to-popover handoff (it may flicker), and whether the top-bar glass hides rows scrolled under it.

# Previous handoff (2026-09-28)

## RP redesign pass (latest)
Dim crimson `delete_action`; `MessageMenu` replaces the reply ⋮ popover; RP home chats list (`RpChatsHome`, `RpChatSummaries`); character panel opens from the reply speaker line (composer pill hidden in RP); solid character panel; Continue is a hidden turn that extends the last reply in place (`continuationBase`, `RpContinuation`, adapter `continuingFrom` seeds the reveal). Full suite passed (485 tests). Phone still has to check: menu/chip feel, home swipe from Ask, Continue seam and fade, panel over a photo background.

Read `CLAUDE.md`, then `AGENTS.md` and `docs/backlog.md`. Branch `liquid-glass-redesign`.

## Codebase pass (2026-09-28, stopped)
Same-job copies in the chat path were folded. The three chat files stayed one file each. Fast unit tests passed (`testDebugUnitTest -Pfast --offline`). Not a release build, and the screenshot suite was not re-run.

- One SSE reader and one non-stream delivery. Sampling is `ChatRequest.withSampling()`. Citations stay on a tool-call reply. A fatal finish reason returns before image download.
- OpenAI-compatible LAN model lists share `fetchOpenAiModelList`. Ollama stays separate.
- Send and resend share the endpoint choice and the network turn. Read and open share one workspace lookup. Text and image downloads share one MediaStore write each.
- An old OpenRouter cache with no reasoning flags refetches once (`open_router_reasoning_migrated`). A later list whose first model is not reasoning stays.
- Dead code removed along the way: old EPUB writer, unused Brave search, disabled speech-to-text leftovers, unused prefs, and the one-line stream wrappers.

`ChatFragment`, `ChatViewModel`, and `ChatToolRuntime` are still long. Shrinking them further means a split. `ChatStreamHost` and `ChatToolHost` still forward one-line calls; that is the boundary of the existing split.

## Previous handoff (2026-09-27)

The full suite (426 tests) passed at b9789d9. Dev APK `GradatiON-dev-b9789d9.apk` was sent to the user.

## Done this session
- K1: Code transcript tool calls are single quiet lines. The session menu toggles Normal/Thinking
  view (`CodeStore.showThinking`, `CodeTranscriptAdapter.verbose`).
- R1: `RpPromptEngine` got per-character Memory (`SharedPreferencesHelper.getRpMemory`),
  `{{char}}`/`{{user}}` macros (the persona preset name is the user's name), scene-craft rules,
  and example dialogs on their own lines.
- R3: an empty RP composer turns send into Continue (`ChatViewModel.continueRpStory`, a "…" user
  beat plus `CONTINUE_DIRECTION`). The character pill opens `RpCharacterPanel`: titled glass cards
  (Memory, History, Persona, Style, Lore, Edit), with New chat and Switch in the header.
- P1: new `screenshots/` and fastlane shots, plus rewrites of README, `DESIGN.md` (the Grok token
  dump and `SHELL.md` are gone, still in history) and the store descriptions. `AGENTS.md` is new.

## Next
- Lorebooks match the scene (`RpLore`). Text above the first `[keys: …]` line is always included. A block under that line is included only when the recent chat, the character's name, or the scenario mentions a key. A character can pin its own book from the Lore card.
- Drop order: history goes first. Once it no longer fits, a long card keeps its first 4,000 characters (`RpApiMemory.definitionCap`). Long-press a Roleplay line to pin it; that line stays. A pin shows a small mark.
- Memory is the note you write and is not rewritten. Facts are a separate per-chat note (you, the character, and other people). The RP setting turns Facts off. A new chat asks to carry them or start fresh. Example lines use a stand-in name, not yours. `RpAutoMemoryTest` and `RpPromptEngineTest` passed.
- RP auto memory is done: after a reply, once the chat nears the API window (or 60 messages when
  memory is "All"), a quiet non-streamed call (`LlmService.completeOnce`) rewrites the character's
  Memory, at most every 6 messages. Switch in RP settings. The demo model answers it too. Voice/Layout/Wallpaper cards are done (RpVoiceDialog, ChatAdapter.rpLayout,
  AmbientBackgroundView.photoSlot with BackgroundPhoto slots "char_<id>").
- The old scroll-progress bar (the full-width line under the tabs) is off by default and fades
  when idle if someone turns it on.
- The phone still needs to check: Continue feel, the panel's blur and lens, the Thinking toggle, and
  all motion.

## UI clip pass (2026-09-27, fresh screenshots, not the old checklist)
Clipped labels, verified with the screenshot tests that cover each screen:
- RP settings Facts switch wrapped so "Your Memory note is left alone." is fully visible.
- Add-machine dialog wraps agent pills (Grok Build, Cursor CLI, Pi were off the card) and shows the
  full bridge example `wss://studio.tailnet.ts.net:7878/v1` under the address field.
- Code settings Demo machine row shows "nothing leaves the phone."
- Lorebook editor shows "Always-on lore, then [keys: word, phrase] blocks" under the field. It was a
  one-line hint cut at "phra…", then a helper line the text box covered.
`assembleDev` succeeded. The minified APK is `app/build/outputs/apk/dev/app-dev.apk`.
Phone still has to check motion, glass blur, and the Thinking toggle.

## UI bug pass (2026-09-27)
UI audit + fixes (112a867..27bf705): glass Snackbars (theme inverse colors), PDF Snackbar crash on a
recycled row, Markdown viewer follows the palette, shimmer pauses offscreen, shared Coil loader,
masked API-key fields, one-shot system message pick, visible checkbox checks, failures raise
GlassNotice (toasts stay silent), Code session edge to edge, 44dp hit areas (`TouchTargets`), glass
settings cards, strings moved to resources. 443 tests pass. `rpAutoMemoryUpdatesAfterReply` was stale
after the Facts split; it now checks Facts (and that Memory is untouched), and DemoModel answers the
"fact notes" prompt. Skipped: HTML/PDF export colors, GlassNotice under dialog dims, CodeHostDialog 36dp pill.
Phone: touch edges of send/mic, Code session insets + IME, Snackbar look, settings cards on a photo bg.

## User bug list (2026-09-27, evening)
All 19 items from the owner's list, 452 tests pass, `assembleDev` built.
- History panel: the chat is pinned to the panel's edge (`historyChatOffset`), not a 0.25 parallax.
  The parallax showed both screens' look-alike chrome at once ("the UI doubles").
- Mode pager: a cancelled swipe left the chat pages a page off screen (page animators ended after
  the reset); `restModePages` cancels them first. Swipes can't start on the bottom bar band
  (`bottomBarTop`, includes Code's composer).
- Tab underline: `BotModelPickerFragment` used `replace` for LAN/OpenRouter, which rebuilt the chat
  view; the new view kept the old underline target and sat at x=0. Both fixed.
- Roleplay/Code switches apply at once: `ChatFragment.watchModeSwitches` (prefs listeners,
  `CodeStore.addEnabledListener`). Settings opened from history never hid the chat.
- Controls panel is a bottom sheet now (moved into `rootLayout` above the composer, dim over all).
- `PickerPopover`: second tap on its control folds it (`isOpenOn`), it follows its edge while the
  keyboard drops (`refit`), and modal cards frost what's behind (`BackdropBlur`). The four list
  PopupWindows blur behind their window (`BackdropBlur.behind`).
- Messages: new `ic_msg_*` stroke set, bare user action row, thinking header without a chip
  (thoughts hang off a hairline), reply actions hidden while streaming (`ChatAdapter.replyInFlight`),
  code card header row with a Copy chip that has an icon and turns into "Copied".
- Code: gear on Code home removed (top-left opens the same screen). Approval modes have icons
  (`CodeComposer.permissionIcon`) in the popover, the pill and Code settings.
- Voice: the mic check no longer swells; `VoiceWaveView` runs ~30fps while listening and glides.
- Motion pass: gesture settles carry the release velocity (`Motion.Fling`), shared per group of
  layers. Mode pager, history open/close/cancel (chat no longer drifts off the panel edge on
  cancel), sheet drag-back and Code session swipe-back use it. Swipe commit is projection
  based with a flick-back cancel. Toggle pill spring-follows, groove fill follows the pill.
  Phone: feel of all of these; the pager's first-frame snapshot may still hitch on old phones.
- Switches: every screen is a SwitchCompat (MaterialSwitch sized differently). Redesigned after
  iOS 26 (the owner picked "clear lens" from five mockups): 60x28 groove, 36x24 clear pill
  that redraws the groove magnified inside itself (the track clips the pill out so fills don't
  stack). It swells and magnifies harder while held, dragged or sliding (the thumb watches its
  own bounds move, since SwitchCompat cancels pressed on drag). Geometry lives in the track's
  side padding (`GlassSwitchTrackDrawable.getPadding`).
- Photo background blur is about 2.4x softer.
Phone: every motion above, the Controls sheet under the nav bar, blur cost on an older phone.
